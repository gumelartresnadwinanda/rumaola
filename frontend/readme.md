# Why a Frontend Directory?

This repository will contains both the backend (API/server) and the frontend code for the Rumaola project. Keeping the frontend in this repo allows for easier development, testing, and deployment of a full-stack application. It ensures that both backend and frontend are always in sync and can be developed together.

## What Should Be Included

- **Frontend Source Code**: All React
- **Static Assets**: Images, stylesheets, fonts, and other assets used by the frontend.
- **Build Tools/Configs**: Configuration files for build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.), linters, and formatters.
- **README**: Documentation for setting up, running, and building the frontend.
- **Environment Files**: Example `.env` files for frontend-specific environment variables (do not commit secrets).

> Place all frontend-related files and folders inside this directory to keep the project organized and maintain a clear separation between backend and frontend
